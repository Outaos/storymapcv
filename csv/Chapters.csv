"Ternopil, Ukraine",media/ternopil.jpg,Source: Ternopil/Wikimedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternopil,"I was born in a small, beautiful town in Western Ukraine, which is probably the most 'Ukrainian' town in the country.<br>
The place craved democracy, and freedom and, since the 1990s, had a massive desire to join the EU.<br>  
Here is where my basic values were formed, where I met my first friends, tried my first work, and read my first books.<br>
Growing up in Ternopil, I learned how to play the violin and survive in the wild. Both of those skills became handy later, even though I never expected them to be useful. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",8,Plain,blue,Ternopil,49.5535,25.5948,,0.7,geojson/teStories.json,color:red;weight:3
"Kyiv, Ukraine",media/shevchenko.jpg,Source: Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv,https://www.knu.com.ua/,"I moved to the capital when I was 17 to study history at <a href='https://www.knu.com.ua/' target='_blank'>Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv</a> .<br>
It was the best university in the country, and I was granted a scholarship because I was among a handful of people who scored 200 out of 200 on the national exam. That was probably my first significant achievement, and I worked hard for it.<br>
Back then, just like millions of young people worldwide, I had little idea what I wanted to do with my life, and I think history attracted me because I always liked stories. I am happy about it, as studying at Kyiv University certainly contributed to my development.<br>
I also thought of studying geography, which I was always good at, but I did not see how I could apply it in the future. Back then, I knew nothing of GIS, which was a gap in my schooling.  <br> <a href='media/certificate200.pdf' target='_blank'>External independent testing results</a>  <p>&nbsp;</p> ",8,Plain,blue,Kyiv,50.4501,30.5234,,,,

It was not the most pleasant job, but it taught me a lot. That job made me more independent and responsible, and it contributed to developing my communication skills and allowed me to understand better what kind of person I want to be.<br>
It was also my first time working in a different language environment. Everyone spoke Russian in that part of the town, and I had to adopt it for work. It was not easy, but it was worthwhile.<br>
I remember the managers asked me to learn the menu, and the next day they were astonished that I knew it by heart. They said that nobody had ever done it in that place. I felt good about it. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",11,Plain,blue,Egoist club,50.413074,30.661334,,,,
The Carpathian and Crimean Mountains,media/carpathians.jpg,The Crimean Mountains,,"During my student years, I also hiked a lot. Climbing a mountain is a challenging undertaking, and it requires self-control and determination. However, it is also rewarding as it provides a sense of achievement. My friends and I organised numerous hikes in Carpathian and Crimean Mountains. Needless to say, it was before 2014.<br>
It was a summer job for me too. I lead groups of people into wilder parts of the mountains. Often these groups included foreigners, and it was my first working experience in English.<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",6,Plain,blue,The Crimean Mountains,44.46888,34.034219,,,,

AIESEC contributed massively to the development of my values and my leadership skills. In spring 2013, I was a team leader of five people with whom we organised various events for foreign interns in Ukraine. Our team also helped with logistics, as Kyiv was a hub from where many AIESECers moved to different parts of the country.<br>

Because of this desire, I applied for an interesting AIESEC environmental program in Guangzhou. I was accepted, and my fantastic China experience began.<br>
For nearly half a year, I worked with a group of international volunteers. Together we studied the environmental situation in the Pearl River Delta region and prepared educational presentations.

I was accepted for a two-year program at the newly created Business School of Beijing Foreign Studies University. There were many foreign professors from as diverse places as Singapore and Lancaster.<br>
During this program, I learned a great deal about various business practices in China and abroad and improved my communication and marketing skills. Because of the numerous exchange programs with the universities in Europe and North America every semester, I made new friends who often were extraordinary people who chose to come to China instead of an 'easy exchange' in a developed country.<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ",10,Plain,blue,Beijing,39.953678,116.302226,,,,

"Freetown, Sierra Leone",media/freetown.jpg,,,"Probably the most memorable and positively impactful projects I worked on was in Sierra Leone. I spent around a month in a country doing an on-field assessment. The project aimed to assess and report the state of school infrastructure in the city. The Sierra Leonean government wanted to provide tablet computers to every school in the capital. I personally visited numerous schools to inspect the infrastructure's conditions and the access to electricity. Unsurprisingly most schools that had poor infrastructure were located in informal settlements. These schools required special attention; however, there was little data related to electricity grids in the informal settlements, and even their extent and population were unclear.<br>
Relying on my on-field inspection and various available spatial data, I used ArcGIS software to analyse and map the precise extent of Freetown's informal settlements and the schools that were in most need of direct assistance. I presented my report before senior management and government officials, which directly influenced the distribution of the project's resources. 
Later, at the University of Manchester, I used these findings as the basis for one of my assessments. The <a href='media/freetown.pdf' target='_blank'>resulting paper </a> explains my reasoning and demonstrates my ability to use ArcGIS software to solve complex spatial problems.

As I wanted to develop myself professionally and have enjoyed working with spatial data and environmental projects, I resolved to develop myself in the GIS field after my contract with GSafety ends.<br>
However, the COVID pandemic corrected those plans. In many ways, accelerating them. After all the lockdowns in China and abroad, the business realities for GSafety changed dramatically, and the work on overseas projects was greatly reduced. In addition, my wife could not return to Beijing as the Chinese government shut down the borders to all foreigners and for most of 2020, I have not seen Veronika, which was hard. Considering all of the above, I have decided to terminate my contract with GSafety, and we agreed to end our cooperation in August 2020.",8,Hidden,blue,"Gsafety, Beijing",40.006294,116.333986,,,,

It still amazes me that despite growing up in different environments, we developed very similar values and have similar worldviews. Since we met, Veronika has been an immensely supportive and loving person, and she is a significant part of my life.<br>
As the hybrid war between Russia and Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014, and I could see firsthand that Russia has moved in the wrong direction, I never intended to stay in Moscow. I used my time there to develop myself and make my GIS dream closer. I have completed several online courses related to GIS and programming. I have also taken some tests and applied to a handful of universities in Britain to develop my GIS career.

For my final dissertation at the university, I developed a full-stack multimedia location-based web application to connect people and places through personal stories and street art. I used open-source JavaScript libraries (leaflet.js and turf.js), as well as HTML and CSS, to make the app interactive and engaging. I relied on the Python Flask framework to deploy the app and enable users to add independently created location-based content. SQLAlchemy was used to add and manage multimedia content and spatial data in the SQLite database.
